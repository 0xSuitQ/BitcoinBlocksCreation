# BitcoinBlocksCreation

Backpack with Bitcoin transactions

You are a developer of the Bitcoin mining software. The goal is to implement the most efficient method for constructing the block, which extracts the biggest fee from the userâ€™s transactions. There are several requirements:

- As input, the program receives an array with 100,000 transactions
- Each transaction has 2 arbitrary parameters that need to be accounted for:
	- Size (in bytes)
	- Fee (in number of satoshies)
- The program's output is the Bitcoin block, which is limited to 1MB
- The extracted fee must be the biggest possible

Create a console app that consumes the file with transactions. The input is a CSV file with the following structure: `tx_id, tx_size, tx_fee`. The amount of transactions is limited to 100,000 (optionally unlimited).

The program should display the following output:

- Constructed block
- Amount of transactions in the block
- The block size
- The total extracted value
- Construction time
- The max memory dedicated to storing intermediate pre-calculations
- The probability of the extracted fee value being the biggest (optionally)

## How to run

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the program by typing `./bitcoinBlockCreation`.
4. Enter a name of the .csv file with transactions. I already have randomly generated files with 100,000 transactions, so you can use those.
5. If you want to see all transactions after the block is created press `y`.

## Efficiency

The solution is efficient in terms of both storage and execution time. Here are some reasons why:

- Vector Usage: Employs std::vector for transactions and block.transactions. Vectors efficiently manage memory, dynamically adjusting size as needed, avoiding unnecessary allocations or unused space.
- The core logic is streamlined, focusing on essential tasks for block creation without extraneous processing.

Approximate amount of time spent on the task: 3h
